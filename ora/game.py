        In general, ult charge goes down when:
        1) ult ability is used
        2) player switches chara
        3) For D.Va it's a bit more complicated -- a player with his
        meka down can always go back to spawn room and get his meka again by
        switching chara. In this case, theoretically we should sense a chara
        switching event, thus it's usually same as condition 2). But what if
        that chara switching event isn't detected? Buh-oh. However when a
        player does this, it's only for when he has a mini-D.Va (i.e. with a
        meka down event beforehand). Since now we don't have D.Va status
        detector, we leave this one for later.
